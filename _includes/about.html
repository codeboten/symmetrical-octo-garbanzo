                OpenTelemetry provides the tools necessary to gain visibility into the performance of services via an open standard. Its users can instrument their application code through vendor-neutral APIs, libraries, and tools.<br/><br/>

                With this book, readers will learn about the concepts and signals of OpenTelemetry - traces, metrics, and logs. They will use these signals by configuring telemetry pipelines and instrumenting a distributed cloud-native application. The book explains the details of the OpenTelemetry Collector and its deployment scenarios. Finally, using open-source telemetry open-source backends, readers will learn to analyze the data to identify application performance issues.<br/><br/>

                By the end of this book, the reader will be well-versed with the core concepts of OpenTelemetry and be ready to instrument their services using OpenTelemetry. <br/><br/>
